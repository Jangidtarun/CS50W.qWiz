# CS50W Final Project [ qWiz ]

## Project Description

This project is a dynamic quiz-taking platform where users can engage in quizzes on a variety of topics. Users have the freedom to choose a quiz based on their preferred topics from a vast, user-generated question bank. Any registered user can contribute questions to the platform, tagging them with specific topics for easy filtering, thus constantly enriching the quiz database.

### Key Features:

1. **Quiz Customization**: Users can select the number of questions and specific topics they want to focus on, allowing for a tailored quiz experience.
2. **Question Bank Contribution**: Users can contribute questions to the platform, and each question can be categorized by topics. This ensures that the quiz content is diverse, up-to-date, and community-driven.
3. **Instant Quiz Mode**: For those looking for a faster, more gamified experience, the "Instant Quiz" mode challenges users with a timed, rapid-fire quiz where one question is presented at a time, enhancing engagement through a game-like format.
4. **Discussion Panel**: Each question features a discussion panel where users can engage in meaningful conversations, clarifications, or debates about the question's topic or answer. This fosters a community of learning and shared knowledge.
5. **Voting System**: Users can vote on the quality and relevance of questions. High-quality questions receive more visibility, while poor or outdated questions can be flagged by the community.
6. **Responsive Design**: The platform is mobile-friendly, ensuring users can take quizzes or contribute on any device, be it a phone, tablet, or desktop.

This web application not only enhances the quiz-taking experience with personalized options and gamified features but also cultivates an interactive community where users are actively engaged in both creating and discussing quiz content.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Why This Project is Distinct and Complex

This project stands out from other web applications due to its unique approach to personalized learning and its community-driven, gamified quiz experience. Unlike a typical social network or e-commerce site, this platform is designed to provide a versatile and engaging learning environment through user-generated quizzes, real-time interactions, and community discussions.

### Unique Use Case

This platform serves a distinctive purpose by combining personalized quiz experiences with community collaboration. Users can not only take quizzes based on their selected topics but also actively contribute to the platformâ€™s question bank, making it an ever-growing resource for learners. The "Instant Quiz" mode adds a gamified twist to traditional quizzes, providing an interactive, fast-paced quiz-taking experience that heightens user engagement. The discussion panels attached to each question foster a sense of community where users can debate or clarify answers, enhancing the overall learning experience.

### Complex Features

- **Question Bank Creation**: One of the key complexities is the ability for users to contribute to the platform by submitting their own questions. Each question is categorized by topics, allowing for dynamic filtering and search options. Users can customize their quiz by selecting the number of questions and the topics they wish to focus on, creating an adaptable and flexible quiz experience.

- **Voting and Discussion System**: The platform includes an advanced voting system where users can upvote or downvote questions based on their relevance and quality. Additionally, the discussion panel allows users to engage in threaded conversations for each question, promoting a collaborative and interactive learning environment.

- **Instant Quiz Mode**: The "Instant Quiz" feature presents quizzes in a gamified format where users answer one question at a time under a time constraint, adding complexity in terms of user interaction, time management, and dynamic content display.

### Innovative Design

The user interface is designed to provide a seamless experience across devices with mobile responsiveness as a core focus. The layout and design ensure ease of use, with intuitive filtering options for quizzes, a real-time timer in the instant quiz mode, and smooth navigation across different sections such as the question bank, discussions, and user profiles. The voting and discussion system also gives the platform a social, interactive aspect that adds depth to the quiz experience.

### Technical Complexity

This application incorporates multiple layers of technical complexity, from back-end model design to front-end interactivity:

- **Django Models**: The application features complex relational models to manage user-contributed questions, votes, quiz attempts, and user interactions. Topics are associated with questions, and each quiz is dynamically generated based on user inputs such as the number of questions and chosen topics.

- **Real-time Interactivity with JavaScript**: The front-end is enhanced using JavaScript to manage dynamic content updates, such as real-time quiz timers, question navigation, and instant feedback. The discussion panel uses JavaScript for loading new comments without refreshing the page, providing a smooth user experience.

- **Advanced Querying**: Complex queries are used to efficiently retrieve user-selected questions based on topics and other filters. Additionally, the voting and rating system involves real-time data updates, requiring synchronization between the front-end and back-end.

- **Gamification**: The instant quiz mode adds an extra layer of complexity, as it requires real-time tracking of user progress, a countdown timer, and seamless transitions between questions.

## Technologies Used

- **Back-end**: Django 5.1.1
- **Front-end**: JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Additional Tools**: Bootstrap Icons and pillow

### File Contents

- **models.py**:

  The `models.py` file defines the database schema for a quiz application using Django. It includes ten models: `User`, `Question`, `Topic`, `Vote`, `View`, `Choice`, `Result`, `UserAnswer`, `Quiz`, and `Comment`. The `User` model extends the default `AbstractUser` model, adding fields for the user's profile picture, bio, and a Many-to-Many relationship with `Topic` for user interests. The `Question` model contains fields for the question text, points, and an associated author, along with a Many-to-Many relationship to `Topic` for categorizing questions.

  The `Topic` model allows for the organization of questions into various topics. The `Vote` model captures user interactions with questions, enabling users to upvote or downvote questions and ensuring that each user can only vote once per question. The `Comment` model facilitates discussion by allowing users to comment on questions, associating comments with both the user and the question. Then there's `Choice` model that store an answer [correct or incorrect] for a `Question`. The `Quiz` model keeps track that after submitting a quiz user cannot submit the same quiz again. `Result` as its name store the results for a particular quiz and the `UserAnswer` model store that in some quiz a user selected some answer for some question. Together, these models create a comprehensive structure for managing users, questions, topics, votes, answers, results and comments within the quiz application.

## Additional Information

### Areas for Future Improvement

Future enhancements could include implementing user roles with distinct permissions, enabling a richer user experience with features such as bookmarks for favorite quizzes and enhanced analytics on quiz performance. Additionally, incorporating machine learning algorithms to suggest quizzes based on user preferences could greatly improve engagement. The interface could benefit from further usability testing to refine the user experience based on real user feedback.
